# Test
Create a Spring Boot microservice that exposes a REST API with a single endpoint that returns a
JSON document like this one:
{
 "instance": "<Microservice Instance ID>",
 "clientIp": "<Client IP>"
}
Where the microservice instance ID is configurable and the client IP is the IP of the client that made
the HTTP request.
The rest of the details are up to you
